### An AI-powered cognitive tutor for mastering any subject.

[**Live Demo**](https://study-buddy-ai-tutor.onrender.com)

AIML Navigator is a full-stack web application that acts as a personal AI mentor to help users learn any complex subject. From technical fields like "Deep Learning" to creative skills like "Music Theory," the application provides a structured, interactive, and deeply contextual learning experience, guiding any user from novice to knowledgeable.

## The Problem

Learning a new, complex subject is incredibly challenging for self-learners. They often face information overload, a lack of structured paths, generic content that fails to connect concepts, and ineffective quizzes that test memorization over true understanding. AIML Navigator was built to solve these problems.

## Core Features

* **üß† Personalized Roadmap Generation:** Enter any topic, and the AI generates a logical, step-by-step learning curriculum, breaking the subject down into manageable modules.

* **üìñ Context-Aware Explanations:** Get in-depth explanations for each step. The AI explains *why* each concept is crucial for the main topic, using analogies and connecting theory to practice.

* **üéØ Content-Grounded Smart Quizzes:** Test your knowledge with application-based questions generated *exclusively* from the explanation text you just read, ensuring 100% relevance.

* **üí¨ Interactive AI Tutor:** Have a follow-up question? Chat with the AI Tutor, which has the full context of the main topic and the specific sub-topic you're studying.

* **‚öñÔ∏è Compare & Contrast Tool:** Enter any two concepts to get a dynamic, AI-generated comparison table, perfect for clarifying confusing ideas.

## Technology Stack

This project is a full-stack application built with a modern and robust technology stack:

* **Backend:** **Python** with the **Flask** web framework.

* **AI Integration:** **Google Gemini 1.5 Flash** via the `google-generativeai` library.

* **Frontend:** **HTML**, **Tailwind CSS**, and modern **JavaScript**.

* **Deployment:** Hosted globally on **Render** with a **Gunicorn** production server.
